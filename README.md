An email sender
Uses modules smtplib and getpass
If using with Gmail you first need to go to Gmail and set up an "app password" and use that as there is no 2FA here and with that it's not needed.
Probably needs some tweaks to use on other services but it is quite simple and easy to code changes or turn it into a bulk sender if needed.
Check my other repo for a email receiver that is unfinished and needs some love.
